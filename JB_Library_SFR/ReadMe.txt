Zeke76 - JB_Library - 03/14/2015

Actual credit for these collections belongs to Jacques Brault.

This is a collection of 3 libraries created by a long time X-Planer, Jacques Brault. I emailed Jacques and received his OK to put this package together. In keeping with his naming convention, I called the collection JB_Library. This library represents an excellent collection of objects and a lot of hard work by Jacques. My only contribution was to make a single library from the three and add the library.txt. I have kept the individual libraries intact so they include the pictures of all the objects and the Sketchup files he has provided.

To install, simply put the JB_Library in your Custom Scenery folder.
